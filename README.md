# airport_app

To set up the app, run:
- npm install
- npm run build
- npm run server:dev

Routes to access the API are:

- localhost:3000/api/flights
- localhost:3000/api/flights/arrivals
- localhost:3000/api/flights/departures
- localhost:3000/api/flights/flight/*flight number*
for example: FR6698, BE6602, etc...

This app was built as a challenge from Edinburgh Airport, taking an existing JSON file and accessing it as an API. I had some spare time, so it seemed a shame not to add a frontend as well.
